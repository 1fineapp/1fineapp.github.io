	<h3 class="mt-5" id="about">About the App</h3>
	
    <p class="lead">Every person needs motivation. And motivation is needed in two main things: to do something and not to do something. The <b>$1 Fine</b> app gives users double motivation: setting a reward for a person for doing something and paying a fine if they don't. <br>
For example, a person sets himself the goal of running 2 kilometers in the morning, clearly indicating in the application the name of the task, the date of completion, the award and the fine amount. If a person completed task, then he rewards himself, for example, a delicious breakfast or a shower, if doesn't or he gave up , then he pays a fine. <br>So, a person develops a habit, due to which it will be easier to do something useful (or, on the contrary, not to do something in an attempt to quit a bad habit) rather than not to do it.
The influence of these two factors on human motivation has been scientifically proven over and over again.<br>
The application will be useful for most people who are looking for motivation to change their lives for the better.</p>
